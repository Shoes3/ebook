Shoes
=====

## Welcome to the Shoes 3.2 wiki

This wiki contains information that's important to anyone who wants learn more about Shoes. There are things that are not in the built-in manual you might like to know about. 

## Beginners 

Just go to the [Shoes website](http://shoesrb.com/) and download Shoes. You can also find the [Shoes manual](http://shoesrb.com/manual/Hello.html) and a book, [Nobody Knows Shoes](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/shoes/shoes/nks.pdf). That'll get you started building applications with Shoes.

Have a question? -  You should join the Shoes mailing list by sending an email to shoes@librelist.com and ask.  That's also a good place to discuss bugs if you don't want to get a github account. 

Need a Beginners Guide to Ruby? - I recommend [Programming Ruby, The Pragmatic Programmers Guide](https://7chan.org/pr/src/ruby.pdf) aka the PickAxe book. It doesn't cover Shoes - it's for Ruby. I suggest buying the hardcover book - my copy is always open to some reference page or another. 

## Intermediate Level
Perhaps you already know everything about Ruby (congrats!) or you're a command line maven and Shoes doesn't do what you want. Or maybe you're curious to read more. Shoes is all about learning and exploring. If you see something below that you don't understand, just file it away for further cogitating. Reading is not harmful. Acting without knowledge can be harmful but it's trait I live with.

Actually, Shoes might do what you want if someone would write it down so you can find it so you can experiment and learn more. You should join the mailing list and get a github account and file bug reports (or answer them) at the [Shoes issue tracker](http://github.com/shoes3/shoes/issues)
